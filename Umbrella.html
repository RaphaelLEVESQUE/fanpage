    <section><h4>Les paroles</h4>
        <p class="couplet">Uh huh, uh huh<br>
    Yeah, Rihanna<br>
    Uh huh, uh huh<br>
    Good girl gone bad<br>
    Uh huh, uh huh<br>
    Take three, action<br>
    Uh huh, uh huh, Hov<br>
    No clouds in my stones<br>
    Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank<br>
    Comin' down at the Dow Jones<br>
    When the clouds come, we gone<br>
    We Rocafella<br>
    We fly higher than weather<br>
    In G5s or better<br>
    You know me<br>
    In anticipation for precipitation stack chips for the rainy day<br>
    Rain Man is back with little Ms. Sunshine<br>
    Rihanna, where you at?<br>
    You have my heart, and we'll never be worlds apart<br>
    Maybe in magazines, but you'll still be my star<br>
    Baby, 'cause in the dark<br>
    You can't see shiny cars<br>
    And that's when you need me there<br>
    With you I'll always share<br>
    Because </p><br>
    When the sun shines, we'll shine together<br>
    Told you I'll be here forever<br>
    Said I'll always be your friend<br>
    Took an oath, I'ma stick it out 'til the end<br>
    Now that it's raining more than ever<br>
    Know that we'll still have each other<br>
    You can stand under my umbrella<br>
    You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh<br>
    Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh<br>
    Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh<br>
    Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh<br>
    <p class="couplet">
    These fancy things will never come in between<br>
    You're part of my entity, here for infinity<br>
    When the world has took its part<br>
    When the world has dealt its cards<br>
    If the hand is hard, together we'll mend your heart<br>
    Because</p><br>
    When the sun shines, we shine together<br>
    Told you I'll be here forever<br>
    Said I'll always be your friend<br>
    Took an oath, I'ma stick it out 'til the end<br>
    Now that it's raining more than ever<br>
    Know that we'll still have each other<br>
    You can stand under my umbrella<br>
    You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh<br>
    Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh<br>
    Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh<br>
    Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh<br>
    <p class="couplet">
    You can run into my arms<br>
    It's okay, don't be alarmed<br>
    Come into me<br>
    (There's no distance in between our love)<br>
    So gon' and let the rain pour<br>
    I'll be all you need and more<br>
    Because</p><br>
    When the sun shines, we shine together<br>
    Told you I'll be here forever<br>
    Said I'll always be your friend<br>
    Took an oath, I'ma stick it out 'til the end<br>
    Now that it's raining more than ever<br>
